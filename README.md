 # 🌟 ScholarshipHub 🚀

ScholarshipHub is a comprehensive Scholarship Management System designed to assist students in searching for suitable universities and scholarships. It also facilitates the application process, allowing students to apply for scholarships directly through the platform. The system supports three types of users: default users, administrators, and moderators. Upon registration, a user is assigned the 'user' role by default. Administrators have the capability to change user roles as needed.
